# Windows Helm Charts for Lift-n-Shift

The Helm charts in this repository help legacy windows customers to easily deploy (,maintain and upgrade) their containerized legacy applications onto Kubernetes.

The charts work out of the box with Azure Container Registry. The deployment documentation is based on AKS-HCI environment but the charts can also be used for other Kubernetes distros with minimal/no change.
